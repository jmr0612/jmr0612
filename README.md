## About Me

I am a current Lieutentant with my local police department. I worked at my department for over 13 years. I have been an investigator, a manager and leader. I am in the process of switching careers and have completed the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. 

## Objective

My love for investigations, during my time as a detective, and my interest in technology has lead me down the path of cybersecurity. I plan to continue learning and break into the field of cybersecurity. On my free time, I have built a computer with my son, use sites such as TryHackMe and Hack The Box.
